    <p>"Had he and I but met 
            By some old ancient inn, <br>
We should have sat us down to wet <br>
      Right many a nipperkin! <br><br>
      
      "But ranged as infantry, <br>
            And staring face to face, <br>
I shot at him as he at me, <br>
            And killed him in his place. <br><br>

            "I shot him dead because — <br>
            Because he was my foe, <br>
Just so: my foe of course he was; <br>
            That's clear enough; although <br><br>

            "He thought he'd 'list, perhaps, <br>
            Off-hand like — just as I — <br>
Was out of work — had sold his traps — <br>
            No other reason why. <br>
<br>
            "Yes; quaint and curious war is! <br>
            You shoot a fellow down <br>
You'd treat if met where any bar is, <br>
            Or help to half-a-crown." <br><br>
